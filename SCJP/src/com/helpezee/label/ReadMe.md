Java does not support goto, it is reserved as a keyword just in case they wanted to add it to a later version.

Unlike C/C++, Java does not have goto statement, but java supports label.

The only place where a label is useful in Java is right before nested loop statements.

We can specify label name with break to break out a specific outer loop.

Similarly, label name can be specified with continue.
