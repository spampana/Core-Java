/*
 Java didn’t comes with any ready make file copy function, 
 you have to manual create the file copy process. 
 
 To copy file, just convert the file into a bytes stream with 
 FileInputStream and write the bytes into another file with 
 FileOutputStream.

The overall processes are quite simple, just do not understand 
why Java doesn’t include this method into the java.io.File class.
